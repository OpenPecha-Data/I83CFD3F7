In the Indian language: madhyamakāvatāranāma In Tibetan: dbu ma la 'jug pa zhes bya ba In English: Entering the Middle Way
Homage to the youthful Mañjuśrī.
The First Ground: Joyous
From mighty sages hearers and half-buddhas come, While buddhas from the bodhisattvas are conceived. Compassion, non-duality, awakening mind – These are what serve as causes of the victor’s heirs. (1.1)
----------
----------
----------
----------
----------
----------
----------
----------
----------
----------
Since love is like the seed for the abundant crop Of victorhood, is like the water for its growth, Like maturation for its yield to then endure, It’s therefore that I praise compassion first of all. (1.2)
----------
At first, the though of ‘I’ and clinging to a self; Then ‘This is mine’ as they become attached to things. I bow to that compassion which sees every life As powerless as buckets on a water-wheel. (1.3)
----------
Just like the moon reflected in a rippling pond, They see them waver, empty of inherent being.
----------
----------
----------
----------
----------
----------
----------
The victor’s offspring filled with these compassionate thoughts Will feel compelled to rescue each and every one. (1.4) They dedicate just like Samantabhadra prayed, Established on the Joyous which is called the first.
----------
----------
At present, signifying what they have attained, The epithet of bodhisattva is now theirs. (1.5)
----------
They’ve taken birth as kin of the tathāgatas; Their fetters three have thus been utterly dispelled. These bodhisattvas now endowed with utmost joy Are able to make hundred world systems vibrate. (1.6)
As they’re progressing ever higher, ground to ground, The paths to lower states have now been fully barred, All ordinary states of being brought to close, And they are now akin to the eighth noble one. (1.7)
Though just the first taste of complete awakening, In strength of merit they now conquer and surpass The solitary buddhas and the Sage-speech born;
Unrivalled in their insight too on Far Advanced. (1.8)
----------
----------
----------
----------
----------
To bring the realisation of full buddhahood, The first which now is stressed is generosity.
And when they even give their own flesh graciously, From that one may infer what cannot be perceived. (1.9)
All beings long for only happiness, But people will not be content when poor. And seeing that it is what fosters wealth The Sage would first teach generosity. (1.10)
And even for the inconsiderate, The crude whose sole pursuit is their own ends, It’s giving which provides desired wealth And brings about relief from suffering. (1.11)
It’s when one trains in generosity That one can swiftly meet with noble ones, Thus end the sequence of existences And reach the goal, the final state of peace. (1.12)
For those committed to the benefit of all, The joy that giving grants will not be long delayed. So both for tender-hearted and the callous ones Advice on generosity is cardinal. (1.13)
The joy the buddha heirs experience as they Are asked ‘Please give!’ and merely contemplate these words, Won’t even favour sages when they enter peace. No need to mention then the act of giving all! (1.14)
----------
Their own experience when cutting off their flesh To offer it to others makes them recognise How those in hell and elsewhere suffer agony; They set about to swiftly bring this to an end. (1.15)
To give without a giver, gift, recipient, Now this is a perfection that transcends the world.
As long as there is still attachment to these three, We call it a perfection that remains mundane. (1.16)
A joy now settles in the bodhisattva’s mind And gives this fine support a splendid radiance, A joy just like the moonstone which can banish all Oppressive darkness, making them victorious. (1.17)
Thus is the first resolve from Entering the Middle Way.
The Second Ground: Immaculate
Provided with pure traits of perfect discipline They shun misconduct’s blemish even when they dream,
And cultivate the tenfold path of righteous acts With ways immaculate in body, speech and mind. (2.1)
----------
----------
And it is in this tenfold virtuous path They now excel, becoming purer still. Forever stainless, like the autumn moon, It beautifies them with a peaceful glow. (2.2)
Believing discipline to be by nature pure Will in itself deprive it of its purity. And thus they never harbour any concepts which Consider a distinction in the threefold sphere. (2.3)
Although a person’s moral footing is corrupt, To give grants affluence though in the lower realms. But when the funds and profits have been fully spent, One can’t expect that there will be a future yield. (2.4)
If one is free and in an advantageous state But makes no further effort to remain therein, When falling into the abyss, all free will lost, How will one manage to escape these states again? (2.5)
And thus, as soon as generosity was taught, The Victor then went on to speak of discipline. If in the field of discipline one’s qualities Can flourish, yields can be perpetually enjoyed. (2.6)
For ordinary beings, those born from his words, Those who will self-awaken and the conqueror’s heirs, It’s discipline and nothing else that is the cause That brings about true excellence and higher states. (2.7)
----------
Like corpse and sea will not remain in company, Like luck and mishap are not seen to coexist, The eminent who are upholding discipline Will not with those of wayward conduct wish to mix. (2.8)
When keeping discipline with notions of the three – Abstention with an agent, object and an act – It’s said to be perfection that is just mundane. It’s supramundane when not entertaining these. (2.9)
The moon-born victor’s heir – the glory of this world While yet transcending it – completely free from stain; Immaculate, just like a soothing autumn moon Dispelling all the agonies in beings’ minds. (2.10)
Thus is the second resolve from Entering the Middle Way.
The Third Ground: Luminous
A fire burning with the fuel of objects known Produces light; this third ground thus receives its name, The Luminous, as here for the sugatas’ heir A copper-glow appears which is just like the sun. (3.1)
If out of baseless fury someone were to come And sever from their body all their flesh and bone, To torture them, cut piece by piece and take their time, Towards their butcher tolerance will only grow. (3.2)
When bodhisattvas see that there exists no self, What’s cut, the cutter, time of cutting and the mode, Phenomena like these appear reflection-like, An insight through which they are able to forbear. (3.3)
If you resent the one who’s caused you injury, Does your resentment take away the harm that’s done? To bear a grudge will serve no purpose here and now, And also brings adversity in lives to come. (3.4)
The karmic outcome of non-virtue in the past Is held to be the thing that brings it to an end. So why then keep on sowing seeds of suffering By angrily inflicting harm upon your foe? (3.5)
One’s anger for the victor’s heirs will instantly Destroy the virtue gained from generosity And discipline throughout a hundred aeons; thus No evil is there quite like one’s intolerance. (3.6)
It fouls one’s features, steers one to unholy ones. Deprives one of the means to tell what’s right from wrong. Intolerance will send one straight to lower states.
The qualities of patience are their opposites. (3.7) Forbearance makes one beautiful, it grants esteem Among the holy, makes one morally adept; In future lives one will be human or divine, And every negativity will disappear. (3.8)
The common beings and the victor heirs who see The faults of enmity and patience’s qualities, Should shun intolerance and always try to have Forbearance, something that is praised by noble ones. (3.9)
Though dedicated for complete awakening, It’s still mundane if the three reference points remain. When free from these three references, the Buddha taught The same to be perfection that transcends the world. (3.10)
This ground is where the victor heirs now entertain Absorptions and the supernormal sense powers. Attachment, anger – these have been completely spent. They’re able to subdue mundane desirous love. (3.11)
----------
----------
----------
----------
----------
----------
----------
----------
----------
The Sugata would chiefly recommend these three, Of giving and so forth, to lay practitioners. And as they are the merit-type of gathering, They bring about the buddha in corporeal form. (3.12)
On Luminous, where bodhisattvas stay like suns, The murkiness within themselves has been dispelled. They now intend to shed all beings of their gloom. But though intense upon this ground, no anger stirs. (3.13)
Thus is the third resolve from Entering the Middle Way.
The Fourth Ground: Radiant
Good qualities come in the wake of diligence; What brings one stores of merit and intelligence. As this is where their diligence is burning strong, This ground, the fourth among them, is the Radiant. (4.1)
There now appears for the sugata heirs a light More bright than copper, born from cultivation of The thirty-seven factors of enlightenment –
----------
----------
----------
----------
And any sense of self is now entirely gone. (4.2)
Thus is the fourth resolve from Entering the Middle Way.
The Fifth Ground: Hard to Conquer
Great beings on this ground so Hard to Overcome Cannot be conquered even by the demon hordes.
With excellent absorption these high-minded ones Are masters in the subtle nature of the truths. (5.1)
----------
----------
----------
Thus is the fifth resolve from Entering the Middle Way.
The Sixth Ground: Present
On Presence, with their minds now placed in equipoise, They’re in the presence of the traits of buddhahood. Dependent rising is the fact they now perceive – And reach cessation, resting in intelligence. (6.1)
A single sighted person may with ease escort The blind in scores wherever they should need to go. And likewise, for these virtues that possess no sight, It’s insight that can shepherd them to victorhood. (6.2)
----------
As he was one who reached the deepest dharmic truths Relying on the scriptures and through reasoning, By following the system of Nāgārjuna, As found within his works, I shall proceed to speak. (6.3)
----------
----------
Some common people, when they hear of emptiness, Will find that great delight comes surging from within, A joy so fervent, filling up their eyes with tears, And causing every single hair to stand on end. (6.4) Such ones possess the seed of the awakened mind, Are vessels for the teachings on reality. They should receive instructions on the ultimate truth,
As they will see related qualities emerge. (6.5) A person who will always live by discipline, Who gives in generosity and cultivates Compassion, trains in tolerance, and dedicates His virtue to awakening for beings’ sake; (6.6) Who for the bodhisattvas shows sincere respect,
And is insightful in the ways profound and vast; In due course such a person gains the Joyous ground. If this is your objective, hearken to this path. (6.7)
----------
It can’t come from itself, and how from other things? Can’t come from both, how could it be without a cause?
If it came from itself there would be nothing gained. What is produced, produced once more – that makes no sense. (6.8)
To think that what’s produced is then produced again Would mean that sprouts and such could never be procured. The seed would be produced until the end of time – How could what will destroy it ever come to be? (6.9)
A sprout distinct in shape, hue, taste, strength, ripening, And different from its cause, could not exist for you.
Its former likeness left behind as it adopts Another form, what’s left of its identity? (6.10)
And if, for you, the seed and sprout are indistinct, The so-called sprout should like the seed not be observed. Or, since they are the very same, just as the sprout They both should then be seen – thus do not make such claims. (6.11)
It’s when the cause has ceased that its result is seen, And thus that they’re the same is not the worldly view.
So, neither in reality nor in the world Is this imagined self-production reasonable. (6.12)
If one accepts self-rising, maker and the made, As well as act and actor, these would be the same. They’re not, so self-arising I cannot accept – The faults entailed have been elaborately explained. (6.13)
----------
If something different could give rise to something else, Then utter darkness should emerge from tongues of flame. And anything could be produced from everything, Since in their difference all non-makers are the same. (6.14)
‘What has potential to be made defines result. What can produce it is the cause, though something else. In one continuum, from makers, things arise, And rice sprouts won’t therefore produce barley and such.’ (6.15)
Take species such as barley, ironwood or dhak: These can’t produce a rice-sprout, lack that potency, Don’t share continuum, lack similarity. With otherness, a rice seed too lacks in these ways. (6.16)
The sprout is never there the same time as the seed, So how can seed be other without otherness? Thus since one cannot prove that seeds give rise to sprouts, Give up this view that things arise from something else. (6.17)
----------
‘As when you see the levers of a balance scale Ascending and descending simultaneously; Just so producers cease as what’s produced appears.’
If coinciding, yes – they don’t, so this can’t be. (6.18)
While made it faces its production, isn’t yet. While ceasing it still is, but tends towards its end. So how can this be similar to a balance scale?
Arising with no subject doesn’t make much sense. (6.19)
----------
----------
Were eye-mentation separate from what’s making it, Like co-occurring eyes, perceptions and so forth, What purpose would production serve for what exists? The problems faced if it does not have been explained. (6.20)
If separate things are made by a productive cause, Do they exist or not? Both? Neither of these two? Why need producing if they do? What’s done if not? What’s done if both? What’s done if neither of the two? (6.21)
----------
----------
‘What is the point of all these reasoned arguments When it’s the normal view the world gives credence to. The world indeed agrees things come from other things, Which means other-production – what is there to prove?’ (6.22)
The things perceived may either be correct or false. As such all things convey a dual character. Correctly seen, the object is reality; As taught, the truth is relative when falsely seen. (6.23)
As faculties may function well or be at fault, One further reckons two types of the falsely seen. Compared to knowledge stemming from sound faculties, What’s known through faulty faculties is held as false. (6.24)
Perceptions of the world that happens when Six faculties have not been compromised Are true within the world, the rest are all Considered false according to the world. (6.25)
Ideas diverse misguided thinkers have made up When tossed around within the sleep of ignorance, And notions from illusions, mirages and such, Not even worldly folk will think that these are real. (6.26)
Perceptions of the ones impaired by eye disease Cannot invalidate what’s known by healthy ones. Just so, a mind which lacks the wisdom beyond taint Cannot invalidate a flawless intellect. (6.27)
It’s relative, delusion, when the real is masked. Regarding as the truth what is in fact contrived Is relative truth, this is what the sage expressed – And that which is contrived is simply relative. (6.28)
----------
That faulty image one presumes – those falling hairs Which come when one is suffering from an eye disease – Is seen for what it is by one with proper sight; At present we may thus deduce reality. (6.29)
----------
If worldly standards were correct the world would see Reality; what need for other noble ones? Would there be reason to traverse the noble path? It’s senseless that the standards of a fool are sound. (6.30)
Since worldly standards are not valid all the way, The world cannot disprove what is reality. But worldly objects are agreed on in the world, So they’ll disprove you if you do reject these things. (6.31)
A worldly person may just sow a seed But later say, ‘I have produced this child,’ Or else believe that he, ‘did plant this tree.’ No other-rising hence within the world. (6.32)
Because the sprout and seed are not distinct, Seeds haven’t been destroyed when sprouts are there. And since they neither are the very same, We wouldn’t say the seeds exist with sprouts. (6.33)
----------
If things existed with their own identity, Rejecting this would mean the ruin of these things, And emptiness would be destroying entities. This makes no sense, and therefore things do not exist. (6.34)
----------
When analysed there’s nothing that remains of things Except the very nature of reality. And thus the things which are conventions of the world Are not to be subjected to analysis. (6.35)
----------
No reasoning permits production from itself Or other at the level of reality. It can’t be justified even conventionally. So then, by what can your production be sustained? (6.36)
Such empty objects as reflections and the like Are not unheard of when conditions do convene. And just as from reflections and such empty things Cognitions with their aspects are indeed produced, (6.37) It is the same with every empty entity, As from these very empty things, things do emerge.
And since true character exists in neither truth, There’s nothing that’s eternal or that terminates. (6.38)
Because it doesn’t really cease to be, Though there’s no substrate, still the potency Of karma stays long after it has ceased, And will produce effects – this you should know. (6.39)
The foolish man who has a pleasant dream Is still desirous when waking up. And likewise, though the karmic act has ceased And lacks reality, it has results. (6.40)
Just as with cataracts one will see hairs And not just any other random thing, Although as non-existents they’re the same The ripened won’t be ripening again. (6.41)
The negative will therefore further woe, While virtues lead to what is fortunate. It’s freedom to see neither good nor bad. To question karmic links was still deterred. (6.42)
And so, for those who are not able to Accommodate the most profound of views, He taught a substrate, that the person does Exist, that aggregates alone exist. (6.43)
He taught by saying I and mine, although Free from the view of an identity. And likewise, though things lack inherent truth, He taught provisionally that they exist. (6.44)
When bodhisattvas dwell within intelligence They know reality to be just consciousness; No subject can be seen without the object, thus They find the triple realm to be the mind alone. (6.45)
It is just like the waves that will appear Upon the ocean as by wind it’s stirred, When from the substrate, seed of all, appears Just consciousness by self-potential spurred. (6.46)
And this dependent nature is the source From whence ideas of real things then appear – Appears without external things, exists, In nature free from all abstracting thought. (6.47)
But how can mind be there without external things? ‘It’s like a dream,’ you say. Well, let’s consider that: For me, in dreams as well my mind does not exist, Which means that your example is not relevant. (6.48)
If mind exists since dreams can be recalled When waking, then external things should too, Since just as you recall the thought ‘I saw,’ You do remember these external things. (6.49)
You claim, ‘It’s not there when one is asleep, because There is no visual consciousness, just conscious mind, Its images believed to be external things. And as in dreams, the same is taking place right now.’ (6.50)
Just like for you externals are not there In dreams, the mind as well is not produced. All three, the eye, the object seen, the mind Which they engender, each of these are false. (6.51) The rest, with ears and such, are unproduced.
The same holds true awake as when you dream Since all things are deceptive; there’s no mind, There are no objects and no faculties. (6.52)
But just as one may see them when asleep, The three are still here now when we’re awake. And just as when awake the three are gone, They’re gone when from delusion’s sleep we wake. (6.53)
The hairs an eye disease will make appear; The mind which the afflicted sense affects; His intellect will see them both as real. With healthy sight they are both seen as false. (6.54)
If there could be cognition without something known, One would expect that healthy vision too should know These hairs when gazing at the spot where hairs appear. This doesn’t happen, hence this cannot be the case. (6.55)
‘There is no ripe potential for the healthy one, And therefore he does not have this experience; It’s not because there’s nothing there that can be known.’ But since potential is unreal this doesn’t work. (6.56)
Potential for what has arisen cannot be, Nor can it be for what in fact is unproduced. With no distinction one cannot distinguish it, Or else the barren woman’s son would be a fact. (6.57)
You may suggest that in the future it will be. But lacking in potential it cannot spring forth. And mutual dependence used to prove something, The wise will say this fails to prove establishment. (6.58)
If it comes from a ceased potential’s ripening, A separate potential then brings forth something. As parts of a continuum must be distinct, One could have everything come from just anything. (6.59)
‘The parts of a continuum are separate, But their continuum is an unbroken whole, Hence there’s no fault.’ ...
----------
‘Promoted by its own potential there appears A ceaseless rising of the visual consciousness, And this potential which supports its consciousness Is taken as the physical eye faculty.’ (6.62)
‘But people cannot see that without outer forms These sense-produced cognitions clearly manifest As blue and such, originating from their seeds, Instead they take the mind to be external things.’ (6.63)
‘The images in dreams are not external things But mind that is assuming shapes resulting from Potentials present. When awake it is the same: There’s nothing on the outside, just the thinking mind.’ (6.64)
If in the dream such blueness may present itself To mind even without the function of the eyes, Then why do these things not appear now to the blind From seeds that ripen though they cannot use their eyes? (6.65)
And if you say it is when sleeping that the sixth’s Potential ripens, and not while one is awake, Then why not say that just as now it isn’t ripe, The sixth’s potential neither ripens in the dream? (6.66)
For just as lack of eyesight cannot be its cause, When dreaming it is not the sleep that is the cause. We therefore grant that there are things as well as eyes That cause our false perceptions seen when in a dream. (6.67)
It seems that every counterargument they have Is nothing more than repetition of their claim. Their case is thus rejected – nowhere will one find The Buddha stating that there are existent things. (6.68)
----------
When yogis train according to their guru’s words And see that skeletons are covering the earth, The three are still considered unproduced, because It’s guidance utilising false mind images. (6.69)
And if you think that these repulsive images Are just like any object that the mind conceives, When other people turn their minds towards such things They should discern them, and these wouldn’t then be false. (6.70)
It’s similar to cataract-inflicted eyes When spirits see a river’s water being pus. In short, please understand that, just as what you know Has no existence, neither does the mind itself. (6.71)
And if detached from subject-object there could be Dependent nature, empty of duality, Then who would know of its existence? Just to say, ‘It’s there but not perceived,’ is quite unreasonable. (6.72)
It isn’t proven to experience itself. And if you say a later memory is proof, You’re giving something that is unproven as proof; And what’s not proven cannot function as a proof. (6.73)
But let’s assume that self-awareness is affirmed. That memory remembers it is still unsound, Because it’s other, like an unknown in one’s mind. This argument will conquer any counterclaim. (6.74)
For us, the one who has the memory is not Distinct from he who had experience of something. To think, ‘I saw,’ is therefore memory to us, As is the way conventional worldly people think. (6.75)
And so, as self-awareness cannot be the case, What is perceiving your dependent nature then? The actor, act and object cannot be the same, And thus to apprehend itself makes little sense. (6.76)
If, even though it is by nature unproduced And isn’t known, dependent nature can exist, How has the barren woman’s son offended them That he should suffer this denial of being real? (6.77)
When this dependent nature can’t exist at all, Then how can it be causing relative events? When so obsessed with substance, our opponents will Just gainsay every normal worldly principle. (6.78)
There is no other method that will lead to peace Apart from noble master Nāgārjuna’s way. But they stray from the truths, the real and relative – One gains not liberation when ignoring these. (6.79)
Conventional truth works as a means to reach an end. The ultimate is like the end one tries to reach. But those who do not see how these should be discerned Are led by faulty fancies down mistaken paths. (6.80)
The claims concerning the dependent you have made, I wouldn’t venture even for the relative. Although they don’t exist, pragmatically I say They do, in order to comply with worldly view. (6.81)
For arhats, who have left behind the aggregates And dwell in peace, these things do not indeed exist. If that was true for those who dwell within the world, I wouldn’t say that from the worldly view they do. (6.82)
But if you think that they will be no match for you, Then go ahead and contradict the worldly view. So let the battle of the world and you commence, And after I shall follow who’s more powerful. (6.83)
In Present’s presence bodhisattvas realise The three realms to be nothing more than consciousness, And seeing that eternal makers are disproved, They understand the maker to be mind alone. (6.84)
And hence to fuel the insight of the clever ones, Make clear the meaning, the Omniscient One expressed These vajra-words in the Descent Onto Langka That shatter lofty mountains of misguided views. (6.85)
A maker, such as those we find described within The scriptures of the various misguided schools, A person or the like, he could not find – and so, The Victor said that mind alone creates the world. (6.86)
Awakened indicates awakened to the truth. And likewise when the sutras speak of only mind It means that mind alone is foremost for the world. Denying matter never was the sutra’s goal. (6.87)
If mind alone in fact was meant to indicate Denial of the physical reality, Then why indeed was mind too by the Mighty One Described to be from karma and confusion born? (6.88)
It truly is the mind that makes the spectacle That is the worlds of beings and environments. It’s stated that all beings’ states are karma-born – Dispense with mind and there will be karma no more. (6.89)
Though matter is a fact, it can’t claim to possess The same creative power that the mind displays. A maker other than the mind is thus denied, But that is not to say that matter is disproved. (6.90)
It is the worldly fact that aggregates are five While one is placed within the world’s reality. But when the wisdom of reality they seek Has dawned, for yogis these will no longer appear. (6.91)
If form is absent don’t assume the mind is real. And don’t insist that form is there without the mind. The Buddha would reject them equally within The wisdom texts – in abhidharma both were taught. (6.92)
Dismiss the tiered system of the dual truth, Your substance is then barred and cannot be maintained. Acknowledge thus that there are levels to the truth: Birth in the world but never in reality. (6.93)
The sutras where it states that what we see is not External, but the mind perceived in various ways, That was provisional, taught to invalidate The physical for those who are attached to form. (6.94)
The Teacher did express it as provisional. Provisionality is shown by reasoning. This scripture makes it clear that other sutras too Of similar sort will likewise be the leading truth. (6.95)
The buddhas taught that when there is no object known The knowing of it will be easy to refute. The known is therefore what’s initially denied, Because without the known the knowing is disproved. (6.96)
And thus you should discern the level of the text: When what is being explained is not reality But leads one, then the sutra is provisional; It is definitive if voidness is the theme. (6.97)
That things arise from both will not be reasonable, Because one will encounter faults explained above. Not in the world nor actually can this be claimed When by each one production cannot be sustained. (6.98)
If causelessly production could in fact take place, Then endless things would always come from everything. And people of the world would not in all these ways Be planting seeds and so forth to make crops appear. (6.99)
If living were devoid of causes one would not Perceive more than the sky-lotus’s scent and hue. But since the dazzling beauty of the world is seen, Just like one’s mind the world arises causally. (6.100)
If it’s the nature of the elements that make Your mental image though its nature it does lack, How could someone so densely dimmed towards this life Be trusted to have knowledge of the lives beyond? (6.101)
When you deny that there are lives beyond this one, Your view of how things are is flawed since such views have This bodily existence as their common ground, Like when you make the claim that elements are real. (6.102)
It has been shown how elements cannot exist, As it was generally disproved things can’t arise From self, other, both, or without a cause; and so Though not explicit, they have no reality. (6.103)
Because things don’t arise from self, other or both, Nor causelessly, they’re nothing in and of themselves. The clouds of dense confusion lie across the world, And therefore objects are perceived mistakenly. (6.104)
An eye disease may cause mistaken visions like Hairs, double moons, the peacock eyes, bees and so forth. The unwise, tricked by their confusion, will likewise Believe the sundry fashioned imagery they see. (6.105)
It is a sign of witlessness if one declares, ‘Confusion causes karma; does not come without.’ Just like the sun of wisdom sheds the nightly gloom, The wise unravel emptiness and are set free. (6.106)
‘If in reality things don’t in fact exist, They’re like a barren woman’s son and should like him Have no existence also as conventional things. They must therefore exist as things inherently.’ (6.107)
Take objects such as hairs, although they are not there, Do still appear to someone who has cataracts. Thus, first of all, please settle your dispute with them. And then go deal with those impaired by ignorance. (6.108)
In fact you too see things that are not really there, The city of gandharvas, images in dreams, Illusions, a mirage, reflections and so forth. So, is it not unsound how these appear to you? (6.109)
Though actually these are as unborn as The barren woman’s son, that does not mean That these things are not seen within the world. It’s therefore not conclusive what you say. (6.110)
A barren woman’s son cannot in fact be born By worldly standards or in true reality. It is the same with anything, they don’t occur As true things in reality nor in the world. (6.111)
The Teacher thus proclaimed that all phenomena Are peace from the beginning, free from any birth, Complete transcendence of a nature that is real, Which means that there is never any birth of things. (6.112)
Though pots and such aren’t there in true reality, The world’s consensus is that they in fact exist. For all phenomena this is the case, which means It doesn’t follow they’re like barren women’s sons. (6.113)
And so, since things do not arise uncaused, Are not the work of an almighty god, Nor are produced from self, other, or both, They are interdependently brought forth. (6.114)
And as all things arise interdependently These theories will not withstand analysis. Submitted to interdependence’s arguments All complex nets of faulty views are ripped to shreds. (6.115)
Such theories are relevant if things exist, But now it has been shown how things cannot exist. Without existents such ideas can’t be maintained, Just like a fire won’t keep burning without fuel. (6.116)
While ordinary men are trapped by theories, By not pursuing concepts yogis are set free. The wise have said that it’s analysis which will Alleviate one of conceptual ideas. (6.117)
He did not for the love of quarrelling present The treatise’s explorations, but to liberate. One can’t be blamed if one’s opponents’ theories Are shattered when unravelling reality. (6.118)
To be too fond of one’s own view, and hostile to The views of others, this is still conceptual. But when desire and aversion are dispelled, Analysis will bring one swift deliverance. (6.119)
They see how all afflictions and all faults Come from the the view of an identity. And realising its object as the self, The yogi goes on to refute this self. (6.120)
Misguided ones belive the self consumes and lasts, Is uncreative, and lacks features or pursuits. The differences between the schools of Tīrthikas Are based on minor variations on this theme. (6.121)
----------
----------
Since it is unborn, like a barren woman’s son, There cannot be a self like that of which you speak, It cannot be the basis for the sense of self – As even relative that would not be allowed. (6.122)
And since its qualities that one may find described Within the various scriptures of the Tīrthikas Are contradicted when they argue it’s unborn, These features will amount to nothing in the end. (6.123)
There is therefore no self distinct from aggregates, Since it can’t be perceived without the aggregates. Since they know no such thing and still think there’s a self, The worldly wouldn’t claim the ego is thus based. (6.124)
Through aeons born among for instance animals, They would not think it unproduced and permanent. Yet still they would be harbouring a sense of self. There is therefore no self distinct from aggregates. (6.125)
Some say no self is found distinct from aggregates, The reference for self-view is thus the aggregates. While some insist all five support the view of self, Some others will insist it is the mind alone. (6.126)
The aggregates are multiple, so if they are The self, the consequence would be a lot of selves. The self is then a substance, and can be observed, And what you can engage is not a fallacy. (6.127)
Nirvana would be the destruction of the self. Before, it would arise and vanish all the time. Without an agent the result would not exist. Distinct are culprit and experiencing side. (6.128)
‘It’s really one continuum, thus we’re not at fault’ – The problems with continua were shown before. The aggregates or mind as self thus makes not sense; The world as finite and so forth was not endorsed. (6.129)
For you, when yogis understand the lack of self, All things would then lose their existence certainly. If it is an eternal self that is dismissed, Then neither mind nor aggregates can be the self. (6.130)
For you the yogi seeing selflessness would not Then realise the reality of form and such. Not having seen its nature, when perceiving form They’re caught by it, creating passion and so forth. (6.131)
That aggregates are self, you base this claim upon The Teacher’s statement that, ‘The aggregates are self.’ But this refutes a self distinct from aggregates, As other sutras state that form is not the self. (6.132)
That neither form nor feeling constitute the self, Nor do perception, formations, or consciousness, Has been proclaimed in various other sutra quotes. In brief, that aggregates are self is not affirmed. (6.133)
When saying it’s the aggregates that are the self, It’s their collection, not the aggregates themselves. But this does not exist, and so it cannot be – Can’t be protector, cannot tame, nor serve as judge. (6.134)
A chariot would be the presence of its parts. As with a chariot, the same goes for the self. ‘Contingent on the aggregates,’ the sutra states. The self is thus not just the aggregates combined. (6.135)
‘It is the shape,’ you say, but shape belongs to form. So though you say it’s these that constitute the self, The mental groups cannot then be what this self is Due to the fact that these cannot assume a shape. (6.136)
It makes no sense that grasped and grasper are the same, Since act and actor then would be identical. ‘There is no actor, just the act,’ you might then think. But no, since without actor there can be no act. (6.137)
The Sage states that the self is recognised With reference to earth, water, fire, wind, To consciousness and space – six elements – And six supports of contact, such as eyes; (6.138)
And is assumed from mind and mental states. And it is therefore these though not the same, Nor just the mere collection they make up. One cannot find the sense of self in these. (6.139)
That seeing selflessness would shed the lasting self While not believing it to be ego’s support, I find it quite astounding then to hear you say That knowing selflessness uproots the view of self. (6.140)
Like he who finds that there’s a snake within his wall, Proclaiming it’s no elephant to ease his fright And to escape the harm the serpent can inflict, Will surely end up being ridiculed by all. (6.141)
The self is not within the aggregates, Nor are the aggregates found in the self. If they were different that could be surmised. As they’re not different it’s but an idea. (6.142)
One cannot claim the self possesses form, because There is no self, so ownership does not apply. One owns a cow: distinct. One has a body: same. But form is not the same nor other than the self. (6.143)
Form’s not the self, the self does not possess the form, There is no self in form, and form’s not within self – All aggregates considered in this fourfold way And added up amount to twenty views of self. (6.144)
The vajra-wisdom seeing selflessness brings down The mountains of the view of self, and when that goes The lofty peaks that rest upon this massive range Of viewing an identity are also crushed. (6.145)
Some claim the person is substantial yet cannot Be labeled same or other, permanent or not, That it’s an object of the six consciousnesses, And claim this is the basis for the sense of self. (6.146)
To say, ‘mind is distinct from body,’ means it’s not Ineffable – real things can’t be ineffable. If self was proven to be real in any way, It would be real, like mind, and not ineffable. (6.147)
Since, as you say, a pot is not real in itself – There’s nothing to point out apart from form and such – Do not then think the self exists from its own side When it’s ineffable except for aggregates. (6.148)
You would agree that consciousness is not distinct From its own self, yet is a thing distinct from form. As these two aspects may be seen in entities, No self exists; it lacks the features of a thing. (6.149)
The basis of the sense of self is thus no thing, Not other than the aggregates, nor them themselves; It isn’t their support, or else possessing them. And yet related to the aggregates it’s there. (6.150)
A chariot is not distinct from its own parts, Nor indistinct, and their possessor it is not, It is not in its parts, they aren’t contained in it, It’s not the mere assembly, nor is it the shape. (6.151)
If just the mere assembly were the chariot, The chariot would be there in the separate parts. Without an owner of the parts they can’t be parts. The chariot as shape will neither make much sense. (6.152)
You say the shape that each part had before Is present now within the chariot. Then just as when it was in separate parts, It’s not there now when there’s a chariot. (6.153)
And if right now, when there’s a chariot here, The wheels and so forth have a different shape, Then this should be perceived, but it is not. The chariot is thus not just the shape. (6.154)
For you, collections are not real at all, Its shape is thus not that of gathered parts. For how could it assume a shape at all, Based on something that’s utterly unreal? (6.155)
But it is just as you yourself assert, That based upon a cause that is unreal Arise results that are themselves unreal. Please see that this is how all things occur. (6.156)
This shows it makes no sense that the idea Of pot comes from these bases such as form. And being unproduced these don’t exist, That they comprise a shape is hence unsound. (6.157)
These seven points leave it unjustified Both in reality, and in the world. But left unanalysed the world will still Identify it based upon its parts. (6.158)
It’s something that has parts, composed of separate bits. A chariot is held to be a functional thing. For people it’s a grasper, and is true as such. Do not lay waste to what the world agrees upon! (6.159)
The yogi asks, ‘These seven points show it’s unreal, So how can it exist?’ – and finds that it does not. With this they easily access the truth of things. That it is real is still accepted here and now. (6.160)
The chariot has no existence, and without An owner of the parts, its parts cannot exist. Like parts that vanish when a chariot is burnt, Are parts whose owner has been scorched by reason’s flames. (6.161)
Just so the world at large agrees the self is based Upon the aggregates, the elements and on The sense fields, it is held to be what grasps these things. The grasping is the act and is the actor too. (6.162)
It is not real, thus not a constant entity, Is not inconstant, has no birth and no decay. Such qualities as permanence do not apply. It’s not the same, nor something that is quite distinct. (6.163)
This self – the sense of ego that is always felt By every kind of being, and the sense of ‘mine’ Which is all that relates to it – confusion spawns As customary fact when left unanalysed. (6.164)
Without a maker there is nothing made, And thus without an ‘I’ there is no ‘mine.’ And with the view that ‘I’ and ‘mine’ are void, It’s liberation that the yogis reach. (6.165)
A pot, a blanket, straw mats, armies, woods, a necklace, or a tree, A house, a cart, a cottage, or else anything that it may be Should likewise be acknowledged as they’re generally made out to be, Because the Mighty Sage would not with normal people disagree. (6.166)
The parts and whole, the traits and qualified, the wish and he who wants, The features, featured, fuel and fire, and all pairs like these are when Examined like the cart shown to exist in none of seven ways. And yet, according to the general consensus they exist. (6.167)
A cause will only be a cause when there’s a product it has made. If it does not produce results, it lacks that which makes it a cause. Results will likewise only come about when there exists a cause. So tell me then, which one derives from which? Which is the first to come? (6.168)
If you suggest that there is contact when a cause makes a result, Then they’re a single force; the maker and result are not distinct. If they’re apart, non-causes are not different from what is the cause. Discarding these two options there’s no other notion possible. (6.169)
But if your cause produces no result, results do not exist. And causes that have no results are not as causes justified. But since these two are both just like illusions I am not at fault In granting that the factual things of worldly life can still appear. (6.170)
‘Does your critique make contact with the criticised, or does it not? This may be asked, and aren’t you then accountable to this same fault?’ ‘As what you say will only serve to quash the view you hold yourself, Your criticism lacks the power to discredit what you aim.’ (6.171)
‘Because your cavilling is subject to the self-same consequence And your denial of existent things is quite unreasonable, Insightful persons will not be convinced by what you have to say. You argue just to quarrel and have no position of your own.’ (6.172)
To claim that it’s an issue whether this critique makes contact with The criticised or not while criticising will only apply To those thinking in absolutes, but we do not endorse a stance, And therefore this unwanted consequence does not apply to us. (6.173)
As when the features of the sun being eclipsed Are also seen in its reflected silhouette, That sun and likeness meet or not is ludicrous, It happens in dependence, just conventionally. (6.174)
Although unreal, it helps us beautify our face. Just so, these arguments that have the power to Refine the face of wisdom can’t be verified. And still, know that the proof they give is realised. (6.175)
Yes, if the reason used as proof were something real, And real also the thing that we attempt to prove, The argument of contact would be relevant. Since it’s not so you’re only troubling yourself. (6.176)
That all things lack reality we show with ease. But it’s no easy matter for our challenger To demonstrate how things exist inherently. Why tax the world with webs of shoddy pedantry? (6.177)
If having grasped the prior points, now please forget This extra censure, that of touch, expressly made. It wasn’t just for frivolous wrangling this was said, But so that such additional points are recognised. (6.178)
That beings may be freed, this selflessness was taught In two ways, of phenomena and personal. And to his followers our Teacher taught the same By classifying it in various different ways. (6.179)
When emptiness is taught elaborately It is of sixteen types, and when condensed It is of four types – this is the approach Adopted in the Greater Vehicle. (6.180)
This being what their nature is, The eye is empty of the eye – The same is true for ears and nose, For tongue, for body and the mind. (6.181)
They neither last nor disappear. Hence all these six, the eyes and such, Possess no nature of their own. This is the inner emptiness. (6.182)
----------
This being how their nature is, A form is empty of a form. And this is true of sound and smell, Taste, texture and phenomena. (6.183)
That form and such are nature-less, This is the outer emptiness. That what is both is nature-less, Is outer-inner emptiness. (6.184)
That everything is nature-less Is what the wise term emptiness. This voidness too is empty of A nature which is emptiness. (6.185)
The voidness of the void is termed The emptiness of emptiness. And this was taught to stop the mind That clings to emptiness as real. (6.186)
The universe and all that live Pervade throughout; it’s infinite Just like the four immeasurables; Hence the immensity of space. (6.187)
The emptiness of space with ten Directions is the emptiness Of the immensity, thus taught To block thoughts of immensity. (6.188)
Nirvana is the ultimate Because it is the highest goal. That that is empty of itself Is voidness of the ultimate. (6.189)
To counter all conceptions of Nirvana being something real, The Knower of the Ultimate Taught voidness of the ultimate. (6.190)
The three realms are declared to be Compounded – from conditions born. That they are empty of themselves Is voidness of compounded things. (6.191)
The uncompounded is that which Does not abide, remain or cease. That that is empty of itself: The uncompounded’s emptiness. (6.192)
When limits have no relevance, We say that it transcends all bounds. That that is empty of itself Is emptiness of boundless things. (6.193)
With no first start or final end Samsara is beginningless And endless; no migration there, It’s like existence in a dream. (6.194)
That this is empty of itself Is called the emptiness of no Beginning and no end; and this The Treatise clearly explicates. (6.195)
To spurn denotes that one rejects Or casts aside. And there’s one thing That one must not let go of, that Should not be spurned or left aside. (6.196)
The fact that what should not be spurned Is likewise empty of itself, Is what is called the emptiness Of that which never should be spurned. (6.197)
The essence of compounded things And so forth aren’t created by Disciples, solitary ones, The victor’s heirs, tathāgatas. (6.198)
The essence of compounded things Is therefore termed their true nature. That that is empty of itself Is emptiness of true nature. (6.199)
The eighteen dhātus, senses six, Sensations that arise from them, All things material and not, All things compounded and what’s not; (6.200)
All such phenomena are void, Are empty of any such things. ‘What can appear,’ such marks aren’t real: The voidness of defining marks. (6.201)
A form is ‘that which can appear.’ A feeling is ‘experience.’ Perception is ‘to grasp at marks.’ Formations are ‘created things.’ (6.202)
‘To recognise specific things’ Is what defines our consciousness. The skandhas’ mark is suffering, The dhātus are a deadly snake. (6.203)
The sense fields, so the Buddha said, Facilitate development. Things that arise dependently Are marked by a collectiveness. (6.204)
To give marks generosity, While painlessness is discipline. To not be vexed is tolerance, And flawlessness is diligence. (6.205)
Absorption is collectedness. Not clinging marks intelligence. And so the six perfections are Described by their defining marks. (6.206)
The dhyānas, the immeasurables, As well as all the formless realms, Were taught by he who knew them well To be unagitated states. (6.207)
The thirty-seven factors of Awakening can ‘bring one forth.’ The character of emptiness Is absence of a reference point. (6.208)
The featureless is peacefulness. The third: no pain or ignorance. The liberations are defined As that by which one is set free. (6.209)
The powers are described as what Delivers utter certainty. The Buddha’s confidences are In essence firm security. (6.210)
The perfect knowledge is defined By boundless eloquence and such. Through great love one accomplishes The benefit of sentient beings. (6.211)
Through great compassion one protects Those suffering. Rejoicing is To feel delight. Non-prejudice Defines impartiality. (6.212)
The eighteen special qualities Unique to Buddha cannot from The Teacher be erased; they are Defined as irremovable. (6.213)

Omniscient wisdom is what has Direct perception as a mark. The other is of lesser type, Not as direct perception seen. (6.214)
Whatever the defining marks Of things compounded and things not, They’re empty in and of themselves, Hence voidness of defining marks. (6.215)
The present instant does not stay, The past and future don’t exist; Because these three cannot be found They are things unobservable. (6.216)
These unobservables are void Of any essence of their own; They neither last nor cease to be – The emptiness of what’s not seen. (6.217)
Since things arise conditionally They are not real as composites. That composites are void themselves Is emptiness of real non-things. (6.218)
In short the term a thing is used Referring to five aggregates. As these are empty of themselves, This is the emptiness of things. (6.219)
And non-thing is, to put it short, Implying uncompounded things. That these are empty of non-things, Is termed the voidness of non-things. (6.220)
That nature is not something real Is emptiness of ‘self-nature’. That such a nature is unmade Is what by nature is conveyed. (6.221)
No matter whether buddhas come Or don’t arrive, the fact remains That everything is emptiness, Acclaimed to be the thing beyond; (6.222)
The final end, reality – Is voidness of nature beyond. All these have been proclaimed in the Perfection of Intelligence. (6.223)
Thus brightened by the rays of clear intelligence They see the triple world as unborn from the start As clear as a myrobalan plum in their palm – Cessation is achieved through truth that’s relative. (6.224)
Although remaining in cessation all the time, Compassion for defenceless ones will still occur. From this point onwards their intelligence defeats Half-buddhas and those born from the Sugata’s speech. (6.225)
They soar ahead of beings, like the king of swans, On white and outstretched wings of truth, the relative And ultimate, and speed ahead on virtue’s wind Across the ocean of the Victor’s qualities. (6.226)
Thus is the sixth resolve from Entering the Middle Way.
The Seventh Ground: Far Progressed
On Far Progressed the bodhisattvas can engage Cessation in each moment, and they now attain A brilliant perfection in their skilful means. (7.1)
Thus is the seventh resolve from Entering the Middle Way.
The Eight Ground: Immovable
To reach yet even greater virtue than before These mighty beings enter the Immovable Where they acquire irreversibility. Their aspirations being fully pure, they are Now roused from their cessation by victorious ones. (8.1)
----------
No blemish will maintain its hold upon the non-desirous mind, And so, upon the eight ground stains are severed, utter peace attained. Afflictions at an end, they now surpass the triple realm, and still The space-like boundless wealth of all the buddhas lies beyond their reach. (8.2)
Although samsara has been stopped, they have attained the powers ten, And through these, manifest in various ways to beings of the world. (8.3)
Thus is the eighth resolve from Entering the Middle Way.
The Ninth Ground: Perfect Intellect
Upon the ninth their power is complete and pure in every way, And likewise fully pure their qualities of perfect intellect. (9.1)
Thus is the ninth resolve from Entering the Middle Way.
The Tenth Ground: Cloud of Dharma
Upon them on the tenth ground every buddha now bestows supreme Empowerment, and through their wisdom they now reach supremacy. Then from these victor’s heirs spontaneous rains of Dharma shower down, Like torrents from the clouds, so beings’ crops of virtue may increase. (10.1)
Thus is the tenth resolve from Entering the Middle Way.
The Ground of Buddhahood
This is the time when they a hundred buddhas see, And likewise come to know that by them they are blessed. For hundred aeons on this stage they can remain, And know precisely what has passed and what will be. (11.1)
These wise ones enter and depart a hundred concentrations, and Are able to make tremble and illuminate a hundred worlds; Displaying miracles they can mature a hundred sentient beings, And have the means to travel to a hundred realms of purity. (11.2)
The scions of the Mighty One unlock a hundred Dharma doors, And in their bodies they reveal a hundred manifested forms. The beauty and the riches of their retinue promotes their own, Reflected in each of the hundred victor’s heirs they make appear. (11.3)
Such are the qualities the wise ones gain upon The Joyous ground, and on Immaculate the same Is gained but then increased a thousandfold. And on The five succeeding ones their qualities increase: (11.4)
They gain these qualities a hundred thousandfold, A billionfold, ten billionfold, a trillionfold, And then ten million trillionfold – thus multiplied In stages by the thousands, all of this they gain. (11.5)
When dwelling on the ground Immovable they are Beyond conceptual thought, and qualities they gain As many as the particles one finds within A hundred thousand trichiliocosmic worlds. (11.6)
And when they find themselves on Perfect Intellect, Such bodhisattvas gain the mentioned qualities Ten times as many as the particles one may Encounter in a hundred thousand countless worlds. (11.7)
So many are their qualities upon the tenth They cannot be expressed by any verbal means. When added up they are in number equal to All atoms that exist, indeed unutterable. (11.8)
They have the power to continuously display Within each pore of their own bodies numberless Awakened buddhas with their bodhisattva hosts, As well as humans, demigods and gods alike. (11.9)
Because the moon is at its brightest shining from a cloudless sky, Ahead you ventured on this ground wherein ten powers are produced, And found in Akanishta what you sought, the stage of utmost peace, Accomplishing the peerless goal endowed with every quality. (11.10)
Just as there is no difference in the space within the different jars, No difference is there in existent things in true reality. Thus, when you came to realise that things are of a single taste, O wise one, in a single instant you knew all which can be known. (11.11)
‘If true reality is peace, the mind cannot engage with it. If mind cannot engage it, then the knowing subject makes no sense. Without a knowing it’s absurd for something to be known at all. And who is that non-knower teaching others, “This is how it is”?’ (11.12)
Reality is unborn, and the mind as well is free from birth. Thus, when relating to this it’s as if it knows reality. For just as it is when the mind takes on the aspects of something That it can know the object, this makes sense from the conventional stance. (11.13)
Through their enjoyment bodies, brought by merit’s force, And through their powers – emanations, space and more – The Dharma’s sounds of true reality emerge, And so reality is known within the world. (11.14)
As when a master potter plies his wheel And labours long to get it spinning well, The wheel will then keep turning without toil And pots and other things can be produced. (11.15)
It is the same for dharmakāya lords Who make no effort at the present time, Yet truly marvellous things do happen in Response to beings’ merit and great aims. (11.16)
When all the brittle twigs of what is known Are burned, peace comes – the Victor’s dharma form. And then there is no birth and no decay, The mind will cease, the kāya manifest. (11.17)
The peaceful kāya, lucid like the bounteous tree, Without conceptual thought just like the wishing-jewel, Grants lasting riches on the world till all are free, Appearing just to those free from complexity. (11.18)
The mighty sages can within a single form And in a single instant demonstrate all past Existences relating to them, though they’re gone, Complete, in detail, and with flawless clarity. (11.19)
They demonstrate completely in a single form How buddha realms and mighty sages did appear; And how their forms, acts, strengths and powers were; The size and manner of the groups of hearers there, (11.20)
And how the bodhisattvas gathered did appear; How was their Dharma, and what standing they did have, The way they studied, and the training they endured, And what amounts were given them in offering. (11.21)
And likewise all their prior discipline, Their patience, effort, concentration and Intelligence, all of these practices They clearly show within a single pore. (11.22)
The buddhas of the past and those to come, Those present now as far as space pervades, How in the world they teach the Dharma’s tunes Relieving beings seized by suffering; (11.23)
And all their works from making the resolve Till wakening; these things they clearly know And demonstrate within a single pore, And instantly, as if they were their own. (11.24)
So too with every deed done throughout time By bodhisattvas, solitary ones, The noble hearers and all common folk, They show at once and in a single pore. (11.25)
Through will power these pure ones can display the worlds As far as space extends within a speck of dust, The speck engulfing the entire universe Without growth of the speck nor shrinking of the worlds. (11.26)
With no conceptual thought you can display In every instant till the end of time Diverse activities as countless as All specks of dust on every continent. (11.27)
The might of knowing what is fact and what is not, And likewise what will be the consequence of acts, To understand the different preferences of beings And what their various abilities might be; (11.28)
To know whose faculties are good and whose are not, Where every path with lead; the might of knowing all Samādhis (concentrations), liberated states, Absorptions, states of equilibrium and such; (11.29)
To have the power to recount all previous lives, To know the processes of death and then rebirth, To know that all defilements have been fully spent; This is a summary of all the powers ten. (11.30)
The wise ones have expressed what is in fact the case When certain causes bring particular results; And endless incorrect and contrary ideas That mars their wisdom have been shed – this is their strength. (11.31)
----------
There’s nothing blocking their ability to see When acts are right or wrong, or neither of these two, Which grant exhaustion, and their various effects; They know all this throughout all time – this is their strength. (11.32)
----------
To know the dispositions prompted by the strength Of passion or the like, in all their different hues, The base, the middling, excellent, and those concealed, For every being throughout time – this is their strength. (11.33)
----------
Proficient in the elements, the buddhas teach The nature of the eye and such as element; The boundless insight of the perfect buddhas see All features of the elements – this is their strength. (11.34)
----------
The total and unhindered understanding of Discursive thought and such – the sharpest, deemed supreme, The dull and middling, lesser ones – and how the eyes And such combine to help us know – this is their strength. (11.35)
----------
To know where all paths lead without impediment – The ones that lead to buddhahood, or wakening Of solitary ones or hearers, or to states Of spirits, beasts, gods, men, or hell – this is their strength. (11.36)
----------
To know for each and every yogin everywhere What is their practice of absorptions, freedoms and Shamatha, and which equilibrium among The nine – that nothing blocks this knowledge is their strength. (11.37)
----------
To see the lives they lived while they were still confused, As well as all past lives of every sentient being, However numberless; their origins, their lands, And how they were – to know all this, this is their strength. (11.38)
----------
To have unhindered knowledge of the birth and death Of every sentient being and the state they’re in, Wherever in the world as far as space extends, In every detail, in each moment, is their strength. (11.39)
----------
The strength of their omniscience instantly defeats Afflictions and their imprints; and afflictions are Blocked by the insight of disciples and so forth – To know this fully without hindrance is their strength. (11.40)
----------
It’s not the limit of the sky that halts a bird. It has to stop because its strength has reached its end. Disciples and the buddha heirs are likewise stopped From voicing all the sky-like buddha qualities. (11.41)
So how could someone such as me be able to Perceive and then convey these qualities of yours? But noble Nāgārjuna did describe them, so I put my qualms to rest and mentioned them in brief. (11.42)
What is profound is emptiness; The vast, the other attributes. By knowing the profound and vast One may gain all these qualities. (11.43)
Unwavering in form, and yet again you come into the world. You manifest descent and birth, and turn the wheel of wakening And peace; thus, through compassion guiding this entire troubled world Entangled in the noose of our obsessions to the tranquil state. (11.44)
To know the true reality, which is unchanging, has no types, Will be the only way that one can rid oneself of every stain. The wisdom that discerns it can’t be classified in any way. The unmatched vehicle you taught is therefore indivisible. (11.45)
Because of these corruptions that make beings lapse into misdeeds, The world lacks access to the buddhas’ province of profundity. But you, Sugata, are endowed with wisdom and compassion’s means, And made the pledge to be the liberator of these sentient beings. (11.46)
Thus, like the adept who will conjure up a city to relieve The travellers bound for the jewel island of their weariness, You taught a vehicle to your disciples that will lead to peace, While teaching something different for the erudite untrammelled ones. (11.47)
O Sugata, through aeons numerous as all The dust there is, you reach perfect awakening In all the buddha fields throughout the universe – But this your secret is not commonly divulged. (11.48)
O Victor, how could you who were conceived By Lady Wisdom, by Compassion nursed, Pass into peace whilst all the world has not Been brought to peace, while space still has not ceased? (11.49)
The love you have for your relations, beings who In ignorance ingest this poisoned worldly food, A mother’s pain for poisoned child cannot compare; And thus, Protector, you do not pass into peace. (11.50)
Illustrious One, you have compassion for this world that garners pain And evil when unwisely thinking entities are real or not; They’re born and pass away, they lose the pleasant, find unpleasant things – Through love for them you spurn your peace, ignore your own transcendent state. (11.51)
The bhikshu Chandrakirti’s way Is based upon the Treatise on The Middle Way, conforming to The scriptures and direct advice. (11.52)
Just as no other source presents This dharma in this accurate way, The wise should recognise that what Is found herein is quite unique. (11.53)
Some, frightened by the oceanic tinge of Nagarjuna’s mind, Have kept their distance to this wonderful tradition; but right now The dew that makes his verses open like a waterlily’s buds Have settled, and the hopes of Chandrakirti, Famous Moon, are met. (11.54)
The scary depths of this reality presented here, is only grasped By those with some experience – though learned, others will not comprehend. Thus seeing them as self-devised traditions – those who claim there is a self, Or any other groups – place not your trust in any other school but this. (11.55)
May all the merit gathered from explaining Nāgārjuna’s way fill all of space, Their intellects, a sky obscured by the afflictions, be lit up by autumn stars, And as they catch the jewel from the cobra’s head, their minds, may the entire world Thus come to understand reality and swiftly travel to sugatahood. (11.56)
This completes Entering the Middle Way, elucidating the profound and the vast, composed by the master Candrakīrti, an upholder of the supreme vehicle who possessed invincible wisdom and compassion, and who by milking the painted cow defeated clinging to true existence. This was translated from a Kashmiri manuscript by the Indian preceptor Tilaka Kalaśa and the translator Patsab Nyimadrak in the Ratnagupta temple in the Kashmiri city Anupama (Shrinagar) during the reign of the Kashmiri king Śrī Āryadeva. It was subsequently edited and finalised based on a manuscript from the eastern country of Aparānta by the Indian preceptor Kanakavarman and the same Tibetan translator in the Ramoche temple in Lhasa (Rasa). The author’s and the translators’ colophons have here been brought into harmony with those of the commentary, and the differences there might have been between the root text and the commentary have been amended.
